ogin to docker hub and create a repository for your image (hub.docker.com Links to an external site.). Once you are done creating the image, you will push into this repository. For this example, Dr. Sanchez created a repository called "abelsan/cabinfever".

Create an application and a docker file for the application. Then, create a docker image for the application. Name your image YourDockerUsername/YourImageName. In this example the username is "abelsan" and the image name is "cabinfever".

# Create Docker image
$ docker build -t abelsan/cabinfever.

Test your new image.

# "-p 8080:3000" sets the container port to 3000 and the host port to 8080
# "--name cabinfeverInstance" sets the container name to cabinfeverInstance
# "-t cabinfever" references the cabinfever image
$ docker run -p 8080:3000 --name cabinfeverInstance -t abelsan/cabinfever

After you confirm your application works, push your image to docker hub.

# Note the username/image matches the Docker repository
$ docker push abelsan/cabinfever

To use the image, enter the pull command.

$ docker pull abelsan/cabinfever
